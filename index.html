As for everyone else at Stripe-- sometimes they'll need to write CSS, usually for our existing user-facing payment dashboard. It makes up a pretty big chunk of our codebase.
<br><br>For some people, it's often not by choice, but because they need to ship some feature they're working on, and adding a button or some message to our dashboard is the last step before they're officially finished, or they're on call and are fixing some CSS bug that the last person introduced with their button addition.
<br><br>Either way, it's almost always more of an annoyance to our developers than a pleasant task. They don't like thinking about CSS. In working on the rewrite of the user dashboard, I'm trying to solve some of these issues.

<aside class="notes">
When we first built our current, existing dashboard we created a handful of reusable backbone views. These then had the honor of having their own reusable CSS for each template.
<br><br>
Everything else was essentially custom per template. Things that weren't obviously Javascript components did not get considered for any sort of CSS reusability.
<br>
<br>
As an example, this modal component, complete with its fancy lightbox javascript functionality, had its own template and CSS.

          <div class="label fragment" style="position: absolute; width: 40%; right: 0px;word-wrap: break-word;">has a few lines in <code><strong style="color: red;">create_new_account_view.scss</strong></code></div>
          </div>

<aside class="notes">
  And we had a bunch of files just like this. It was easy to style each individual view separately at first, especially since SCSS allowed us to nest our selectors. So we could easily go crazy and style away without worrying about affecting other templates.
  <br><br>
  Except sometimes.

<aside class="notes">
  Sometimes, the particular template you're styling might be used in two places. Or nested inside a different template that now has styles that affect it. Either way, just by looking at our file names and structure (the convention is that the css file to style a view is in the same folder as the javascript and template), there's no easy way to tell what side effects the CSS you're writing might have.

So performing this horrible process myself a couple of times and conducting extensive research, here's the four stages of CSS degradation--it's how I believe the CSS in our dashboard evolved with our engineering team and our changing engineering needs:

            <h4 class="fragment">(MVP)</h4>
          </center>

<aside class="notes">
  Stage one is "Determination." This is where we're like 10 people total in the company. We're starry eyed and eager to ship a user dashboard.
  <br><br>
  And we're smart, too, so we'll pull in the best tools, like SCSS, and clearly define how we want to organize our views and CSS-in a way that makes styling them really easy.
  <br><br>
  So we ship and thing and then celebrate. Whoo, mvp!

  Stage two is "Development." This is when we start building the non-MVP features and enhance the existing features. We add a bunch of new views, and everything's still pretty organized, to be honest, and super easy to write! SCSS makes everything so easy! But of course there are inevitably bugs.
  <br><br>
  And inevitably those bugs will leave some poopy code around, because you're just fixing a bug and it's pretty urgent so you left a few !importants in the code but it's okay you'll fix it later.

            <h3>4. Despair</h3>

  Every time I fix a bug something breaks. Our CSS is growing at a rate of 3 poops per week and there's nothing I can do about it because everything is hopeless.
  <br><br>
So let's break down how our existing dashboard's CSS managed to spiral downhill. It's not that in stage 1 we made bad decisions. I think those decisions were 100% the right decisions, and were perfect for our size and expertise and timeline at that time. The way our CSS was handled optimized for fast development and simplicity.
<br><br>But as the organization grew, our CSS needs started to change. Not every engineer that joined was good at or cared about CSS, or had the context to know exactly how every view in our codebase worked or was used.
<br><br>
Regardless, I believe that if we can start over, and treat CSS as a first-class tool, we could avoid some of these problems. You wouldn't write Javascript without tests or a linter, right? Or generally tolerate poop in other parts of your codebase, so why allow it in CSS?
<br><br>
So, what were the problems?
</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2><strong>No tests</strong></h2>
          <h3>"It's almost impossible to test CSS." *</h3>
          <h4 class="fragment" style="float: right;">* sorta</h4>
<aside class="notes">
 Well technically our tests were users writing in about something looking funny.
  We'll go into more about this later.
</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2><strong>No conventions</strong></h2>
          <strong>
          <h5 class="fragment css">
            <code>.potato { span { ... } }</code>
          </h5>
            <h4 class="fragment css"><code>div.potato > span</code>
          </h4>
          <h5 class="fragment css">
          <code>div.potato span</code>
          </h5>
          <h4 class="fragment css">
          <code>.potato-inner</code>
          </h4>
          <h5 class="fragment css">
          <code>.potato_inner</code>
          </h5>
          <h4 class="fragment css">
          <code>#potato_inner</code>
          </h4>
          </strong>

<aside class="notes">
  Well, technically there were conventions. That each template can have an SCSS file. But more specific than that, the actual way the CSS was written had no convention. We'd see everything from nested selectors to very vague selectors to more specifically-named classes of various forms to IDs, even.
</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2><strong>No CSS reuse</strong></h2>
          <strong>
          <h5 class="fragment css" style="color: #454545;background-color: transparent">
            <code>transfers_list_view.scss</code>
          </h5>
          <h5 class="fragment">
            Yep
          </h5>
          <br>
          <h5 class="fragment css" style="color: #454545;background-color: transparent">

          <h4 class="fragment">
            Nope
          </h4>
          </strong>
<aside class="notes">
  And finally, what I think was our most important issue: no css reuse.
  <br>
  Again, technically there was CSS reuse (just not any documented, structured, explicit maintainable kind), in the form of reusing the CSS that styled our "reusable" backbone views. But it was completely undocumented, and never worked in the way you wanted it to, because it wasn't bulit for a variety of contexts. and just looking at a particular view's CSS won't tell you whether or not it's being reused or if it's reusable. There just was no concept of pulling out somethign you think might be reused later, because our Very Organized Folder structure and Very Nested SCSS didn't support it.

This causes:
<br>
<br>
- Too much cruft built up to even tackle the non-MVP problems: mobile readiness, accessibility.
Cycle of more and more poop buildup.
<br>
<br>
- Progressively more sluggish to build new things.
<br>
<br>
- Unhappiness when working :(.
and disdain/shame for the codebase
<br>
<br>
The first time around, no one will debate that we made the right decisinos at the time, given the tools available. It's just that a lot of our tools and decisions didn't optimize for future happiness.
<br>
<br>
So let's start over. This time from CSS first. Since we built the first iteration of our dashboard three years ago, a lot has changed, and a lot more tools are now available to help us solve our problems, and think of CSS as a first class citizen like the other tools that we use. Most developers would cringe if they left crappy Javascript around their codebase, and we should think of CSS the same way.

  Next, let's tackle the previous lack of conventions. Here's what we've settled on in terms of class naming.

          <h3><strong>rework</strong></h3>
          <center>
            <div style="position:relative; width: 300px;">
          <img src="images/rework.png" width="100%" style="visibility: hidden">

   Before we get too much into that, I'll go over the tools we've adopted for our new dashboard over SCSS. SCSS is amazing for CSS experts and makes their lives much easier, but when most of the folks who work on your CSS only know how to append to the file in arbitrary ways that somehow magically work, it's time to try to find a new tool that will give them less rope. Rework is what we ended up choosing.
  <br><br>
  Rework is a plugin framework for CSS preprocessing. In its default form it takes the CSS you give it, parses it into an abstract syntax tree, the compiles it into the exact same thing on the other end

        <section>
          <h3><strong>rework</strong></h3>
          <center>
            <div style="position:relative; width: 300px;">
          <img src="images/rework.png" width="100%" style="visibility: hidden">
          <img src="images/rework.png" width="100%" style="position:absolute;top:0px;left: 0;" class="fragment">

          </div>
          </center>
<aside class="notes">
  Now, you don't need to know exactly what that means, but the gist of it is that during this middle phase, when our input CSS has been parsed, we can write small plugins that will manipulate the abstract syntax tree before it's compiled back into CSS.

  This is super cool because rather than pulling in a monolithic CSS framework for CSS non-experts to use, we are now able to pick and choose specific plugins with limited scope so that non-experts don't append poop to your CSS.

          <h3><strong>SUIT CSS</strong></h3>
<aside class="notes">
  SUIT CSS is a styling methodology for component-based development. It includes a CSS preprocessor built on top of rework as well as a style guide. We borrowed heavily from their style guide in creating our own, and forked the SUIT CSS conformance checker for ours.

              <img src="images/invalid-selector.png">
          </center>
          </strong>

<aside class="notes">
  rework-stripe-conformance is forked from rework-suit-conformance, and enforces that the CSS you write follows our defined rules. Not only does the checker yell at you if your CSS doesn't conform, it won't even build it.
  <br><br>
  As an example, I added .big-number to the big number component, and the build fails with info about where the error is.

<aside class="notes">
  We also pulled in rework-inherit, a plugin that lets us use very simple, very limited inheritance.
  <br><Br>
  One common way to style checkboxes and radio buttons is to hide the native input element, then style an empty label element to look like a checkbox or radio button. Except one's squarish and the other is circlish. And then there's a second label element that would be the actual label of the checkbox or radio button.
  <br><br>
  On the left is only a part of the checkbox component, including all the interactions between the hidden input and the fake label and the real label. On the right is us reusing the checkbox code for the coreesponding three radio button elements. This sort of simple inheritance makes our lives a lot easier, while not being too overloaded and allowing more complex relationships.

  Here's a brief list of the features we've pulled into KFCSS. this includes everything from rework-inherits and rework-namespace ,which you saw in the slides before, to small helpers like rework-move-media, which jus tmoves media queries to the end of the file, and rework-vars, which gives us CSS level 4-compatible variables.

  There's nothing too outrageous here, no nesting, no fancy math or function stuff beyond a simple "calc".
  Again, in general we want to 
Limit the scope of features that the CSS nonexperts like myself can use and abuse and create terrible CSS with.

  You're probably making fun of how ugly our class names are. It does, after all, get quite verbose, especially when you're starting to worry about accessibility and user experience and updating the markup of your components from time to time.
  <br>
there was a bit of controversy when we first introduced these components, around both the long classnames and the verboseness o fhte markup, but the reality is you hopefully will only be writing HTML by hand ONCE. (In fact, if you did write them by hand in more than one place, whenever your components change, you'll need to change them in every single place.) you likely want to abstract them away with templates. In our case we're using Handlebars, but all templating languages work fine.
but when focussed on writing good, clean, CSS and markup that makes sense (instead of just being the simplest possible thing), these classes make it a lot easier to think about how to structure your CSS. 
<br><br>
This is not groundbreaking, but abstracting away components make deleting code easier and upgrading markup for css. no more direct coupling of css to your templates.

  The truth is, testing CSS IS pretty hard.
  <br><br>
  One of the reasons we're ABLE to test now is because we're using CSS components. If you've ever had to visually diff a whole page before, you'll know that it's often not very effective--things are always changing, and you don't want to always play Find the super-subtle Difference every time you make a CSS change.
  <br><br>
  Additionally, the hardest part about testing CSS are the various states your elements can be in. With our small components, we use rework-pseudo-classes to mock these states, so we can declaratively write tests.
  <br><br>
  We then use a tool called Huxley to take screenshots of our tests and diff them.

  In this case, a 2px margin change is very easily and obviously picked up by our visual diffs.

<aside class="notes">
  A bonus you get from checking these screenshots in is that you're able to see the diffs on Github when you commit. The general rule for us is that you shouldn't be merging in these commits unless a designer signs off on your changes. These screenshots make it relaly easy to visualize subtle css changes. Our favorite is the onion skin diff mode on Github :).

  So the benefits seem pretty clear, but why would you take the time to write your own?
  <br>
  It might seem intimidating to build this whole new bootstrap-equivalent from scratch that's custom for your site and design language, but in the long run developers able to focus a lot more on the 10% polish and building, and leave the CSS to the CSS experts.

  And then hopefully a few years from now, instead of trying to figure out what this means when styling an explanation to a form field, we'll know exactly what class to add.
  <br><br>
  The hope is that if we think about CSS first, we're able to think about CSS less.
